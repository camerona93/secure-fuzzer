## SecLists
To promote good development, we decided to make use of some lists compiled specifically for security/fuzzing. A GitHub project consiting of such lists is located at https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists. According to the readme,
>SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repo onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
